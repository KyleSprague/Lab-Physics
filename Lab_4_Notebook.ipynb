Equation Numbers are there\n","\n","We make use of a torsion pendulum with the goal of measuring the gravitational constant $G$. Our pendulum has two point masses (m) where each point mass is a distance $l$ away from the center of the pendulum. The large masses that exert a gravitational force on the point masses are at a distance $H$. We say that the torque on the pendulum exerted by a large mass is equal to and opposite the torque from the torsion fiber. If the pendulum is in a setted state where each point mass makes an angle $\\theta_0$ with the center of the disk, then the torque for the string can be expressed as \n","\n","$$\\tau = k\\theta_0$$  \n","\n","where k is the rotational spring constant. The torque arising from the gravitational force associated with the test mass is \n","\n","$$\\tau = lF2$$ \n","\n","where the factor of 2 arises from the cortribution from each mass. Setting the torques equal to each other, we have, for \n","\n","$$F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$ \n","\n","$$\\frac{2lGMr}{r^2} = k\\theta_0.$$  \n","\n","Note that r is equivalent to the distance between m and M and thus the distance between the small mass m and it's equilibrium position is then H-r. This H-r component forms a triangle with $l$. Looking at this triangle, we see that  \n","\n","$$sin(\\theta_0) = \\frac{H-r}{l}$$ \n","$$lsin(\\theta_0) - H = r.$$ \n","\n","Plugging this back into equation 1, we have \n","\n","$$\\frac{2lGMm}{(H-lsin(\\theta_0))^2} = k\\theta_0$$\n","\n","which we rearrange to become \n","\n","$$G = \\frac{k\\theta_0(H-lsin(\\theta_0))^2}{2lMm}.$$\n","\n","Recall that the moment of inertia for two point masses is \n","\n","$$I = 2ml^2.$$  \n","\n","We can substitute in for k by recalling that a damped harmonic oscillator such as the torsion pendulum wsill have its motion described by a second order linear homogeneous differential equation assuming no external forces are pressent. This ODE can be written as \n","\n","$$I\\ddot{\\theta} + C\\dot{\\theta} + k\\theta = 0$$ \n","\n","where C is the damping constant and I is the moment of inertia. Assuming C = 0 (for now), we construct a characteristic polynomial \n","\n","$$Ir^2 + k = 0$$  \n","\n","with roots\n","\n","$$r = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{I}}.$$  \n","\n","Because our roots are complex, our general colution takes the form \n","\n","$$\\theta(t) = Ae^{-\\alpha t} cos(\\beta t)$$ \n","\n","where $$\\alpha = 0$$ and $$\\beta = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{I}}.$$ Note the similarity between this result and the expected form of the solution \n","\n","$$\\theta = Ae^{\\alpha t} cos(\\omega_0 t),$$ Based on this similarity, we say that \n","\n","$$\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{I}}.$$ \n","\n","Rearranging, we obtain \n","\n","$$k = w_0^2 I$$. Plugging I into equation 6, we obtain  \n","\n","$$k = \\omega_0^2 2ml^2$$ \n","\n","which we can plug back into equation 2 to arrive at \n","\n","\n","$$ G = \\frac{\\omega_0^2 2ml^2 \\theta_0 (H-lsin(\\theta_0))^2}{2mlM}$$ \n","\n","$$ = \\frac{\\omega_0^2 l \\omega_0 (H-lsin(\\theta_0))^2}{M}$$\n","\n","Because our system is damped due to friction with the air, it is unrealistic to have a natural frequency $$\\omega_0$$ in our final result for G. To account for this, we need to solve for $$\\omega$$. To do so, we plug in a a trial solution of $$\\theta = Ae^{-\\alpha t} cos(\\omega t)$$ into the equation for the damped harmonic oscillator, which implies taking the derivative of the trial solution twice to obtain $$\\dot{\\theta}$$ and $$\\ddot{\\theta}$$. \n","\n","$$\\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}[(Ae^{-\\alpha t}]cos(\\omega t) +\n","\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}[cos(\\omega t)](Ae^{-\\alpha t})$$\n","\n","$$= -\\alpha Ae^{-\\alpha t} cos(\\omega t) - \\omega Ae^{-\\alpha t} sin(wt)$$ \n","\n","$$ \\ddot{\\theta} = \\left[  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (-\\alpha Ae^{-\\alpha t}) cos(\\omega t) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(cos(\\omega t)) \\alpha Ae^{-\\alpha t} \\right] + \\left[  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (- \\omega Ae^{- \\alpha t} sin(\\omega t) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(sin(\\omega t)) \\omega Ae^{-\\alpha t}) \\right ] $$\n","\n","$$ = Ae^{-\\alpha t}cos(\\omega t) [\\alpha^2 - \\omega^2] + Ae^{-\\alpha t} sin(\\omega t) [2 \\alpha \\omega]$$. \n","\n","Now that we have our derivatives, we plug them back into equation 4 and similify to obtain \n","\n","$$cos(\\omega t)[I(\\alpha^2 - \\omega^2) - c\\alpha + k] + sin(\\omega t)[I2\\alpha \\omega - C \\omega] = 0.$$  \n","\n","Since each respective component of equation 8 must equal zero, we obtain a system of equations: \n","\n","$$ I[\\alpha^2 -\\omega^2] - C\\alpha + k =0$$ \n","$$ I2\\alpha \\omega - C \\omega = 0$$ \n","\n","Using equation  9, we solve for \\omega^2. \n","\n","$$I \\alpha^2 - \\omega^2 I - c\\alpha + k = 0$$ \n","$$\\omega^2 = \\alpha^2 - \\frac{C \\alpha}{I} + \\frac{k}{I}.$$ \n","\n","At this point, it becomes useful to solve for C using equation 10. The result of this is \n","\n","$$C = 2 I \\alpha.$$ Plugging this into our current expression \\omega^2 yields \n","\n","$$\\omega^2 = \\alpha^2 - \\frac{\\alpha 2 I \\alpha}{I} + \\frac{k}{I}$$ \n","\n","$$\\omega^2 = -\\alpha^2 + \\omega_0^2.$$  \n","\n","$$\\omega_0^2 = \\omega^2 + \\alpha^2$$\n","\n","Now if we substitute our value for \\omega_0 back into equation 7, we get \n","\n","$$G = \\frac{(\\omega^2 + \\alpha^2) l \\theta_0 (H-lsin(\\theta_0))^2}{M}.$$ \n","\n","Angular frequency is $$\\frac{2 \\pi}{T}$$ where T is the period of the oscillation. This implies that the above can be rewrritten as: \n","\n","$$G = \\frac{(\\frac{4 \\pi^2}{T^2} + \\alpha^2) l \\theta_0 (H-l\\theta_0)^2}{M}$$  \n","\n","where we have used the small ange approximation to say that $$sin\\theta_0 \\approx \\theta_0$$. Since we can not solve for $$\\theta_0$$, we approximate its value by using a diagram where $$\\theta = 4 \\theta_0$$. d is the distance between equilibrium points that the sensor reaches when oscillation of the point masses becomes so small as to be undetected. Using L and D where $$\\theta = \\frac{d}{L}$$, we have for $$\\theta_0$$ \n","\n","$$\\theta_0 = \\frac{d}{4L}$$ which we can substitute in to get our final result for G of \n","\n","$$G = (\\frac{4
